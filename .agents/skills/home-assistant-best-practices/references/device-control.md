# Device Control Patterns

> **The YAML below shows config shape, not a file to hand-edit.** Create and update these through the HA config API, which validates the config and needs no restart. Actions and triggers are submitted as part of an automation or script object.

Best practices for controlling devices, triggering from buttons and remotes, and structuring actions.

> **Check for a purpose-specific trigger first.** Since 2026.7 the default building block is
> a purpose-specific trigger/condition — `motion.detected`, `door.opened`,
> `switch.turned_on`, `temperature.crossed_threshold` — aimed at a `target:` that accepts an
> area, floor, or label instead of a list of entity IDs. The generic `state` patterns in this
> file remain correct and are the right answer when no purpose-specific block matches, but
> check for one before reaching for them; see
> [automation-patterns #purpose-specific-triggers--conditions-default-since-20267](automation-patterns.md#purpose-specific-triggers--conditions-default-since-20267).
>
> This does not soften the entity-over-device rule below — it strengthens it. A
> purpose-specific `target:` takes `entity_id` / `area_id` / `floor_id` / `label_id` (and
> `device_id`, which you should still avoid), and targeting an area is what removes the stale
> entity list *and* the `device_id` at once.

## Entity ID vs Device ID

### The Core Problem

`device_id` is a Home Assistant internal identifier that **changes when a device is re-added** (e.g., after Zigbee mesh repair, integration re-setup, or hardware replacement). Automations using `device_id` will break silently.

`entity_id` is user-controllable, stable across device re-adds, and can be renamed for clarity.

### Device Triggers vs State Triggers

```yaml
# WRONG — device_id changes if device is re-added
triggers:
  - trigger: device
    device_id: abc123def456
    domain: binary_sensor
    type: motion

# RIGHT — entity_id is stable and renameable
#    (generic fallback — check motion.detected with an area target first)
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.hallway_motion
    to: "on"
```

### When Device ID is Acceptable

The only cases where `device_id` might be acceptable:

1. **Device-only triggers** - Some devices expose triggers without entities (see Zigbee section)
2. **Temporary automations** - Quick tests you'll delete
3. **UI-created automations** - The UI defaults to device triggers; convert to entity triggers for production

---

## Action Best Practices

### Use target: Structure

Modern Home Assistant actions use the `target:` key to specify entities, areas, or devices:

```yaml
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
```

### Target Types

| Type | Use case | Persistence |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | Specific entities | ✅ Stable (recommended) |
| `area_id` | All entities in a room | ✅ Stable |
| `device_id` | All entities on a device | ❌ Changes on re-add |

### Multiple Targets

```yaml
# Multiple entities
target:
  entity_id:
    - light.living_room
    - light.kitchen
    - light.bedroom

# Area targeting (all lights in living room)
target:
  area_id: living_room

# Combined (entities + areas)
target:
  entity_id: light.hallway
  area_id:
    - bedroom
    - bathroom
```

### Template in Targets

```yaml
# Dynamic entity selection
target:
  entity_id: "{{ state_attr('sensor.motion_zone', 'light_entity') }}"

# All lights currently on (advanced)
target:
  entity_id: >
    {{ states.light
       | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on')
       | map(attribute='entity_id')
       | list }}
```

## Button/Remote Patterns

### First: does the integration expose an `event.*` entity?

Many integrations now represent a stateless button press as an **event entity** rather than
a bus event or a device trigger. Where one exists and is stable, it is the best target — a
normal entity, so it can be renamed, is reachable by area or label, and survives a device
re-add as long as the integration assigns a stable unique ID. Trigger on it with
`event.received`:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: event.received
    target:
      entity_id: event.living_room_remote_button
    options:
      event_type:
        - double_short_release   # values are integration-defined; read them off the entity
```

The available `event_type` values come from the entity's own `event_types` attribute —
read them rather than guessing. A plain `state` trigger on the entity fires on *any* event
type, which is the right choice only when you genuinely want all of them.

Two Zigbee stacks are exceptions:

- **ZHA has no event platform**, so ZHA remotes use the `zha_event` pattern below.
- **Zigbee2MQTT's event entities are experimental and off by default** — they need
  `homeassistant: {experimental_event_entities: true}`, and Z2M documents both the feature
  and its event-type names as subject to change. Prefer its autodiscovered `device` trigger
  or an `mqtt` trigger unless the user has already opted in.

### ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation)

ZHA buttons fire `zha_event` events. Use **event triggers** with `device_ieee` (the device's IEEE address), which is **persistent** across re-adds.

```yaml
# RIGHT — device_ieee is persistent across re-adds
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: zha_event
    event_data:
      device_ieee: "00:15:8d:00:07:26:f2:8a"
      command: "toggle"
```

For a complete multi-button remote with trigger_id + choose, see [examples.yaml](examples.yaml) Example 2.

#### Finding ZHA Event Data

1. Go to **Tools → Events** (named **Developer Tools** before 2026.8)
2. Subscribe to `zha_event`
3. Press your button
4. Copy the `device_ieee` and `command` values

### Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M)

Z2M creates **MQTT device triggers** that are autodiscovered. These are acceptable because Z2M manages the device-to-trigger mapping.

```yaml
# RIGHT — Z2M device_id is managed by autodiscovery
triggers:
  - trigger: device
    device_id: abc123def456  # OK for Z2M, managed by autodiscovery
    domain: mqtt
    type: action
    subtype: single

# Alternative: MQTT topic trigger (more explicit)
triggers:
  - trigger: mqtt
    topic: "zigbee2mqtt/Bedroom Button/action"
    payload: "single"
```

#### Z2M Device Trigger Discovery

1. Open your device in **Settings → Devices**
2. Look for available triggers under "Automations"
3. The UI will show valid trigger types and subtypes

### Z2M vs ZHA Comparison

| Aspect | ZHA | Zigbee2MQTT |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Trigger type | `event` trigger | `device` trigger or `mqtt` trigger |
| Identifier | `device_ieee` (persistent) | `device_id` (autodiscovered) |
| Event name | `zha_event` | MQTT device trigger |
| Button actions | `command` field | `type` and `subtype` |

## Domain-Specific Patterns

### Lights

**Color temperature:** Always use `color_temp_kelvin` (e.g., `3000`). The legacy `color_temp` parameter (in mireds) was removed in 2026.3.

```yaml
# Turn on with brightness and transition
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 80
      transition: 2
      color_temp_kelvin: 3000

# Turn on multiple lights differently
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.main
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.accent
    data:
      brightness_pct: 30
      rgb_color: [255, 147, 41]
```

### Climate

```yaml
# Set temperature with HVAC mode
actions:
  - action: climate.set_temperature
    target:
      entity_id: climate.living_room
    data:
      temperature: 22
      hvac_mode: heat

# Set preset mode
actions:
  - action: climate.set_preset_mode
    target:
      entity_id: climate.living_room
    data:
      preset_mode: away
```

### Covers (Blinds/Shades)

```yaml
# Set to specific position (0 = closed, 100 = open)
actions:
  - action: cover.set_cover_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
    data:
      position: 50

# Tilt control
actions:
  - action: cover.set_cover_tilt_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
    data:
      tilt_position: 75
```

**Speed (2026.9+):** `cover.open_cover`, `cover.close_cover` and `cover.set_cover_position`
take an optional `speed`. The values are per entity: read its `supported_speeds` attribute and
pass one of those strings. A value outside that list raises a validation error. A cover with no
`supported_speeds` ignores the option and moves at its normal speed.

```yaml
actions:
  - action: cover.set_cover_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
    data:
      position: 50
      speed: fast          # one of the entity's supported_speeds
```

### Media Players

```yaml
# Play media
actions:
  - action: media_player.play_media
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
    data:
      media_content_id: "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
      media_content_type: music

# Set volume (0.0 to 1.0)
actions:
  - action: media_player.volume_set
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
    data:
      volume_level: 0.5
```

### Notifications

```yaml
# Mobile app notification
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      title: "Motion Detected"
      message: "Motion in {{ entity_name(trigger.entity_id) }}"
      data:
        tag: "motion-alert"
        actions:
          - action: "DISMISS"
            title: "Dismiss"
          - action: "VIEW_CAMERA"
            title: "View Camera"

# Persistent notification
actions:
  - action: notify.persistent_notification
    data:
      title: "Reminder"
      message: "Check the laundry"
      notification_id: "laundry_reminder"
```

---

## Vacuum Control

```yaml
# Start cleaning
actions:
  - action: vacuum.start
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock

# Return to dock
actions:
  - action: vacuum.return_to_base
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock

# Clean specific areas (2026.3+ — uses HA areas, not vendor room IDs)
# Requires mapping vacuum segments to HA areas in entity settings first
# Supported integrations include Matter, Ecovacs, Roborock (list may grow)
actions:
  - action: vacuum.clean_area
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock
    data:
      area_id:
        - kitchen
        - living_room
```

**Prefer `vacuum.clean_area`** when the user has mapped vacuum segments to HA areas (entity settings). It works across supported integrations without vendor lock-in.

**Fallback:** When the integration doesn't support `clean_area` or segments aren't mapped, use `vacuum.send_command` with integration-specific parameters:

```yaml
# Integration-specific room cleaning (fallback)
actions:
  - action: vacuum.send_command
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock
    data:
      command: app_segment_clean
      params:
        - 16  # Vendor-specific room ID
        - 17
```

Suggest the user configure segment-to-area mapping when possible to avoid vendor lock-in.

## Response Data

Some actions return data. Use `response_variable` to capture it:

```yaml
actions:
  - action: weather.get_forecasts
    target:
      entity_id: weather.home
    data:
      type: hourly
    response_variable: forecast
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      message: "Tomorrow's high: {{ forecast['weather.home'].forecast[0].temperature }}°C"
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Using entity_id in data instead of target

```yaml
# WRONG — entity_id inside data: is the pre-2024.8 form
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    data:
      entity_id: light.living_room
      brightness: 255

# RIGHT — entities go in target:, parameters in data:
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness: 255
```

### Hardcoding device_id for regular devices

```yaml
# WRONG — breaks on device re-add
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      device_id: abc123def456

# RIGHT — entity_id survives a device re-add
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

### Forgetting action data structure

```yaml
# WRONG — brightness_pct at wrong level
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    brightness_pct: 100

# RIGHT — brightness_pct inside data
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
```

## Quick Reference: Action Structure

```yaml
actions:
  - action: <domain>.<name>       # Required
    target:                       # Optional but recommended
      entity_id: entity.id        # Single or list
      area_id: area_name          # Single or list
      device_id: device_id        # Avoid except for Z2M
    data:                         # Action-specific parameters
      parameter: value
    response_variable: result     # Capture response (if needed)
```

## Quick Reference: Trigger Types for Devices

Read left to right and stop at the first column that applies.

| Device type | Purpose-specific (check first) | Generic fallback | Zigbee specifics |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Button/Remote | `event.received` on the `event.*` entity, when one exists | `state` on the `event.*` entity (fires on any event type) | ZHA: `event` trigger on `zha_event` + `device_ieee`. Z2M: `device` or `mqtt` trigger |
| Motion sensor | `motion.detected` / `motion.cleared` | `state` | — |
| Door/Window | `door.opened` / `door.closed`, `window.opened` / `window.closed` | `state` | — |
| Temperature | `temperature.crossed_threshold` / `temperature.changed` | `numeric_state` or `state` | — |
| Switch | `switch.turned_on` / `switch.turned_off` | `state` | — |
| Battery | `battery.became_low` / `battery.no_longer_low` | `numeric_state` | — |

Two rules survive whichever column you land in: **don't key a trigger off a `device_id`**
outside the cases in [When Device ID is Acceptable](#when-device-id-is-acceptable), and
**prefer a `target:` over a list of entity IDs** when the automation is really about "this
area" rather than these specific entities — the area keeps working as devices are added,
swapped, or removed.
